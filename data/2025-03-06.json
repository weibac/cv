  "dev-philosophy": "A synthesis of Agile and Test-Driven Development adapted for the era of LLMs. Focus on thorough requirements analysis and documentation first, operationalized through comprehensive tests. Advocate for functional programming paradigms to enhance testability and allow for the formal verification of critical components. While LLMs have made code generation cheap, designing robust specifications remains critical. Human developers should focus on requirement capture and specification, while leveraging LLMs for implementation that satisfies well-defined test suites. Developers should shift emphasis from code writing to requirements engineering.",

  "preferred role": "My main requirement is to be placed in an evironment that will allow me to work according to the development philosophy I have outlined in this document. This means working for a client who won't meddle in technical decisions, and with teammates who agree with the importance of writing correct specifications. A scenario I can see happening and which I want to avoid is me being placed in a tester role, and being resented by my teammates for correctly pointing out that their probably-LLM-written, definitively-written-from-a-confused-spec code is bad. This is why I ask either for an administrator role leading a ragtag team of autists, or for a combined analyst + architect role in a team where the administrator is unlikely to override me.",
  "metadata": {
  "uri": "https://github.com/weibac/cv",
  "explanation": "This very cv is an example of my development philosophy. The main document I worked and iterated on was a json file. I then had an LLM write functions to compile it into latex code. I used third-party web software (overleaf) to compile the latex into PDF. I have been iterating on the content by adding to it incrementally and looking at how it compiles into PDF. The LLM has been iterating on the code, based on my feedback. I have had to help it debug a couple times, but it can debug by itself most of the time when provided with the appropiate error messages."
